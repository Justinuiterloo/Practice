# Practice CI/CD Pipelines with GitLab

This repository is dedicated to practicing and experimenting with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines in GitLab. The primary focus is on integrating automated workflows for personal projects developed in Python. 

## Repository Overview

This project contains sample Python applications, tests, and configuration files to help me learn and understand how to:
- Set up automated CI/CD pipelines using GitLab.
- Run automated tests, linting, and code coverage reports.
- Deploy or package Python projects using GitLab CI/CD.
- Explore more advanced CI/CD concepts like Docker, caching, and parallel jobs.

### Key Components:
1. **Python Project**: Contains sample Python applications and unit tests.
2. **GitLab CI/CD Configuration**: `.gitlab-ci.yml` is where the pipeline stages (like testing, linting, and deployment) are defined.
3. **Docker Configuration (optional)**: Dockerfiles to build images for testing or deployment.

## Objectives
- Learn how to write and configure GitLab CI/CD pipelines.
- Automate tasks like testing, code quality checks, and deployment.
- Gain hands-on experience with GitLab's CI/CD features for personal Python projects.
